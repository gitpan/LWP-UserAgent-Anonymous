=head1 METHODS

=head2 anon_request()

This is simply acts like proxy handler for user agent. It tries to get  hold of a
valid  proxy  server,  if  it can't then it simply takes the standard route. This
method  behaves exactly as method  request()  for LWP::UserAgent  plus  sets  the
proxy for you. You may find it takes little longer than usual to respond.

    use strict; use warnings;
    use HTTP::Request;
    use LWP::UserAgent::Anonymous;

    my $browser  = LWP::UserAgent::Anonymous->new;
    my $request  = HTTP::Request->new(GET=>'http://www.google.com/');
    my $response = $browser->anon_request($request);

=cut

sub anon_request {
    my ($self, $request) = @_;

    my $clone   = $self->clone();
    my $retry   = $DEFAULT_RETRY_COUNT;
    my @proxies = _fetch_proxies();

    if (scalar(@proxies)) {
        _print("INFO: Max retry: [$retry]") if $DEBUG;
        while ($retry > 0 && scalar(@proxies) > 0) {
            my $proxy = shift @proxies;
            if (defined($proxy) && ($proxy =~ /\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\:\d{1,6}/)) {
                $self->proxy(['http','ftp'], sprintf("http://%s/", $proxy));
                if ($self->_is_success($proxy)) {
                    return $self->SUPER::request($request);
                }
            }
            $retry--;
        }
    }

    _print('WARN: Unable to get the proxy... going no-proxy route now.') if $DEBUG;
    return $clone->SUPER::request($request);
}

=head2 set_retry()

Set retry count when fetching proxies. By default the count is 3.

    my $browser = LWP::UserAgent::Anonymous->new;
    $browser->set_retry(2);
